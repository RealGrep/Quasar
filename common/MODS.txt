Modpacks:
You don't need to ask permission to include this mod in a modpack. However, I do prefer that you include a list of mods somewhere on your site/page/thread with a link back to this forum thread, in case someone wants to report a bug. And while it's not necessary, I would appreciate you letting me know that you're putting it in your pack, and maybe a little about your pack if it's themed in some particular way. That way if someone asks for pack suggestions to try any of my mods, I'll know some to tell them!

Feel free to use Dark Utilities in your mod pack. The only thing I ask is that you link back to this forum page somewhere within your mod pack page (if you make one), and that the mod pack be free for anyone to download. I have absolutely no restrictions on what you can do with the content on the mod. If you would like to use ModTweaker or something similar to change recipes of the content in the mod that is fine with me.
